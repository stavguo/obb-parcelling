# OBB (Object Aligned Bounding Box) Parcelling
A Godot implementation of OBB (Object Aligned Bounding Box) Parcelling to procedurally generate parcels of city blocks.

## Installation
Clone or save this repo locally ([instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)), and then import it using Godot's [project manager](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/editor/project_manager.html).
## Usage
### Generate a City Block
Within Godot, run the scene by pressing the Play Scene button in the top-right of the screen or press ```F6``` (```Cmd``` + ```R``` on macOS).
Every time the scene is run, a new parcel is randomly created.
### Regenerate a City Block
To get a new parcel, you can press the ```R``` key or the ```Enter``` button on the scene window to rerun the scene.
### Take a Screenshot
You can save a screenshot of the viewport to ```screenshots/``` by pressing the ```S``` key.
### Modify Variables
The main logic can be found in the script associated with the parent node, Node2D. The program can be easily configured by modifying the values found in the Godot node inspector tab with the parent node selected. The city block that is parcelled is created by generating ```N``` random points on the circumference of a circle of radius ```R```.
* ```max_radius``` (int): The maximum possible length of radius ```R```.
* ```min_radius``` (int): The minimum possible length of radius ```R```.
* ```points``` (int): The amount of points ```N``` to be generated on the circumference.
* ```min_area``` (int): Minimum area of parcel. Once area is less than ```min_area```, recursion ends and parcel is created.

To register changes, press the ```Tab``` button on your keyboard after modifying an inspector field. Then save the changes and rerun the project.
